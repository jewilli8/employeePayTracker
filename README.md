# employeePayTracker
##Description <p>
This project empowers employers to track employee salaries. The user is prompted to input a first name, last name, and salary for each team member. The output is sorted alphabetically and displayed dynamically in a table generated through the use of Javascript to  manipulate the document object model. The average salary and the name of a random employee are logged to the console. <p>
